# debmake

Creates basic deb packages from git repositories that contain a file named `.debmake` with the package details. Suitable for creating simple packages, that just place some files on the system. Probably not very useful for more complex packages.

For more not so simple packages, please use `dh_make` (`apt install dh-make`).

```sh
apt install devscripts
export DEBEMAIL="you@mail.ch"
export DEBFULLNAME="Your Name"
```

```
apt install build-essential binutils cpp cpio dpkg-dev file gcc make patch dh-make debhelper devscripts \
            fakeroot lintian debian-policy developers-reference man-db manpages reportbug
```

## configuration

create a file `.debmake` in the root directory of the package with the following contents.

required:

```sh
# Target is the path where the package files will be installed (without leading `/`)
TARGET="usr/share/plymouth/themes/dphys-logo"

# The source of the software
HOMEPAGE="https://github.com/rda0/plymouth-theme-dphys-logo.git"

# Short description (max. 80 characters)
DESCRIPTION_SHORT="Plymouth theme for the DPHYS"

# Long description will be broken to multiple lines (at 80 characters)

```
